# ARE YOU HAVE SOME PROBLEM WITH THE SHIT ZJE FORMT?
Here is the converted format just for ZJE. When I am going to upload my BG essay, I found it is so annoying to use the "Cite them right 12 th" even though this format is sightly(lol) close to so-called ZJE format.

# So I edit the csl file!
Yes, you can now download the csl file in this file flod and just open it with the zotero (I am not sure if you use other applications), and zotero will help you to install this format.

# How to use it?
After you install it in zotero, find "ZJE format(converted from cite them right 12th)". Then enjoy your essay referencing!

# Any problem or reporting bug?
Of course, the csl file could have some problems when you reference books, websites (I didn't check them for some reason(lazy)). If you meet any bug or probelm, just contact me in "Issues" or Wechat me if you know me. I will check and edit them if I am availble.
