# STAR THIS PROJECT IF I HELPED YOU (shoudong doge)

# ARE YOU HAVE SOME PROBLEMS WITH THE SHIT ZJE FORMT?
Here is the converted format just for ZJE. When I am going to upload my BG essay, I found it is so annoying to use the "Cite them right 12 th" even though this format is sightly(lol) close to so-called ZJE format.

# So I edit the csl file!
Yes, you can now download the csl file in this file flod and just open it with the zotero (I am not sure if you use other applications), and zotero will help you to install this format.

# How to use it?
After you install it in zotero, find "ZJE format(converted from cite them right 12th)". Then enjoy your essay referencing!

# Any problem or reporting bug?
Of course, the csl file could have some problems when you reference books, websites (I didn't check them for some reason(lazy)). If you meet any bug or probelm, just contact me in "Issues" or Wechat me if you know me. I will check and edit them if I am availble.

# 免责声明
本人自己也采用这个模版，但是这不意味着模版完全正确。事实上，很多细节我并没有处理，但是相比之前的cite them right已经是很好用的一个升级版本了。所以任何因为这个模版造成的失误，请不要怪罪到本人头上（）谢谢大家
